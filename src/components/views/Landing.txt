UWU what's this?
Availability tracker for lewdies :)  basically, who's down for lewding _right now_.

How does it work?
* The site keeps track of your bio, status, and lists other lewdies who are online right now; you can set yourself on/off anytime
* A discord bot automatically sets your availability based on guild status (whether you're online on discord), and pings you whenever you get a request
Simple.

Can I invite my friends?
Only if they're cool, have VR, and don't bring drama. You can create an invite code inside the app, or invite them to our discord to get one:  https://discord.gg/HDZQP6Wb6f

So, what's the status?
We're building :) and super open to chat about anything erp-related
