    <h3>In-VR ERP rules</h3>
    Unless you&apos;ve agreed with your partner otherwise, default rules for
    in-VR ERP are:
    <br />
    <br />
    <li>
      Always make sure your partner is safe, comfortable, and happy, and
      everything is consensual.
    </li>
    <li>
      Do not create drama. If a situation has drama-potential, do not pull peeps
      from vrerp.net into it
    </li>
    <li>
      Have your attention focus on your partner, and the act. Discording while
      your partner is riding on top of you is super impolite.
    </li>
    <li>No photography without consent</li>
    <li>Please be kind, attentive, and lewd to each other! ðŸ’•</li>
    <br />
    You can report violations on the site{" "}
